10. **(optional)**:

If a service wants to route the event also to the general ISC bus `s2a-isc-eventbridge-eventbus`, this can be done. For example, the events can be routed to the general ISC bus `s2a-isc-eventbridge-eventbus`. The routing is done using event pattern matching. 

[Here is the AWS doc of pattern matching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns-content-based-filtering.html)


```javascript
{
  "source": ["oc", "test"],
  "detail": {
    "schema": {
      "eventBusName": [{
        "anything-but": "oc-internal-bus"
      }]
    }
  }
}

```
So if this rule hits, i.e. `eventBusName!=oc-internal-bus` the event would be routed to the `s2a-isc-eventbridge-eventbus`.
